      <description>Recently I stumbled upon info about using Rust language on embedded systems including microcontrollers. I searched for some tutorials and online trainings and it seems like you need specific hardware usually. Getting STM32F3DISCOVERY or nRF52840 DK is not practical because I will have limited use for these boards after completing training. I was almost willing to get micro:bit when I found out that Ferrous Systems and Espressif’s announced Rust Training on ESP32.</description>

      <description>Intro Kafka supports encryption and authentication via SSL. However, the generated certificates are in Java KeyStore (JKS) format so if you need to use them in other language you need to convert them to X.509 format (.pem – Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail).
Here are the commands to extract the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate:
$ keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore dev.client.truststore.jks -destkeystore server.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12 $ openssl pkcs12 -in server.p12 -nokeys -out ca_cert.pem You can then convert your client keystore to be usable from languages supporting .</description>

      <description>If you are a Java programmer and are thinking of learning some more programming languages to expand your knowledge and skills, but not sure which programming languages to choose, then you are not alone. Last year there were multiple talks in our organization about migrating away from Java because o potential problems with new Oracle licensing. It is still unclear how Oracle will be auditing for Java licensing and what it will mean should an organization not be compliant.</description>
