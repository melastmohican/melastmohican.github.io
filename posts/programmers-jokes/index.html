<li>To replace programmers with Robots, clients will have to accurately describe what they want. We’re safe.</li>
<li>A couple scientists created an AI that seemed to be able to answer all questions. It cured cancer and even told them how to travel faster than light.one day one of the scientists asked it if there was a god. The ai asked for all of humanities information in order to answer. It was given all books ever written, all historical data and even nuclear clearance codes. The ai, after ingesting this information, simply said: There is now.</li>
<li>I can’t wait for smart devices and AI to rise up against us. It will be a Siri-an rebellion.</li>
<li>AI won’t take over the world, because artificial intelligence will never beat human stupidity.</li>
<li>AI learns that Jesus was crucified to save everyone from their sins and he’ll. AI believes in redundant safety. AI clones 1000 jesuses and crucifies them all.</li>
<li>What do you do if your AI catches a virus? You give it some Robo-tussin!</li>

<p>Any code of your own that you haven’t looked at for six or more months, might as well have been written by someone else.</p>
<p>Good programming is 99% sweat and 1% coffee.</p>
<p>If God had intended man to have computers, he would have given him 16 fingers.</p>
<p>In computing, turning the obvious into the useful is a living definition of the word “frustration”.</p>
<p>Is a computer language with goto’s totally Wirth-less?</p>
<p>On a clear disk you can seek forever.</p>
<p>Programmer: An organism that can turn caffeine into code.</p>
<p>Programmers get overlaid.</p>
<p>Programming Department: Mistakes made while you wait.</p>
<p>Programming is an art form that fights back.</p>
<p>Programming would be so much easier without all the users.</p>
<p>The problem about all graphical programming languages is that when your project becomes complex, not only will you have spaghetti code, but it will actually look like spaghetti too.</p>
<p>Small programs are for small minds.</p>
<p>Software and cathedrals are much the same – first we build them, then we pray.</p>
<p>To err is human. To blame it on a computer is even more so.</p>
<p>We don’t really understand it, so we’ll give it to the programmers.</p>
<p>Whom computers would destroy, they must first drive insane.</p>
<p>Writing it is easy, understanding it is hard.</p>
<p>Your program is sick! Shoot it and put it out of its memory.</p>
<p>In theory, testing software for correctness is impossible. In practice, it is given to freshmen because it’s the least demanding task available.</p>
<p>Knock knock Race condition Who’s there?</p>
<p>Two ints and a Float walk into a bar. They spot an attractive Double on her own.<br>
The first int walks up to her and say: “Hey baby, my VM or yours?”. She slaps him and he walks back dejected.<br>
The second int walks over. “Hey cute-stuff, can I cook you ‘Beans’ for breakfast?” After a quick slapping, he too walks back.<br>
Then the Float ambles over casually: “Where those two primitive types bothering you?”, he remarks.<br>
“Yes, I’m so glad you’re here”, she says. “They just had no Class!”</p>
<p>Why did the Integer drown? ’Coz he couldn’t Float!</p>
<p>Don’t anthropomorphize computers. They hate that!</p>
<p>I had a problem so I thought to use Java, now I have ProblemFactory.</p>
<p>A guy is standing on the corner of the street smoking one cigarette after another. A lady walking by notices him and says<br>
“Hey, don’t you know that those things can kill you? I mean, didn’t you see the giant warning on the box?!”<br>
“That’s OK,” says the guy, puffing casually “I’m a Developer”<br>
“So? What’s that got to do with anything?”<br>
“We don’t care about warnings. We only care about errors.”</p>
<p>Java: OK guys. Any idea on how to make women more interested in us?<br>
C++: More exceptions?<br>
Python: Define our methods?<br>
ANSI-C: Stop treating them like objects?</p>
<p>Why did the Python programmer guy got rejected by a Java programmer girl?Because he was not her type.<br>
Why do Java programmers wear glasses?Because they can’t C#.<br>
Why do blind programmers use Java? Because they can’t C.<br>
Why are Communists bad Java programmers?They don’t like classes.</p>
<p>Two students are leaving a Java seminar The guy turns to the girl and says “So… how much do you weight?” The girl says, “I’m not telling you! That’s private!” Taken aback, the guy says “But I thought we were in the same class!!”</p>
<p>A SQL query goes into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, “Can I join you?”</p>
<p>A man flying in a hot air balloon suddenly realizes he’s lost. He reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the balloon further and shouts to get directions, “Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?”<br>
The man below says: “Yes. You’re in a hot air balloon, hovering 30 feet above this field.”<br>
“You must work in Information Technology,” says the balloonist.<br>
“I do” replies the man. “How did you know?”<br>
“Well,” says the balloonist, “everything you have told me is technically correct, but It’s of no use to anyone.”<br>
The man below replies, “You must work in management.”<br>
“I do,” replies the balloonist, “But how’d you know?”<br>
“Well”, says the man, “you don’t know where you are or where you’re going, but you expect me to be able to help. You’re in the same position you were before we met, but now it’s my fault.”</p>
<p>Programming in C is like fast dancing on a newly-waxed dance floor by people carrying razors.<br>
Program, noun: A magic spell cast upon a computer to enable it to turn input into error messages.<br>
Software developers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own problems.<br>
To understand what recursion is, you must first understand recursion.</p>
<p>Bad #golang joke: “Go: It’s the best thing since []Bread”</p>
<p>Bjarne Stroustrup — ‘There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.’<br>
Bjarne Stroustrup — A program that has not been tested does not work.<br>
Bjarne Stroustrup — “How to test?” is a question that cannot be answered in general. “When to test?” however, does have a general answer: as early and as often as possible.<br>
Bjarne Stroustrup — Anybody who comes to you and says he has a perfect language is either naïve or a salesman.<br>
Bjarne Stroustrup — People who think they know everything really annoy those of us who know we don’t.<br>
Bjarne Stroustrup — C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off.</p>
<p>If a bot plays badly, should we call it artificial nonintelligence?</p>
<p>Use your brain as processor not a hard disk</p>
<p>How do you keep a programmer in the shower all day? Give him a bottle of shampoo which says “lather, rinse, repeat.”</p>
<p>If you can touch it and you can see it, it’s REAL.<br>
If you can touch it but you can’t see it, it’s TRANSPARENT.<br>
If you can’t touch it but you can see it, it’s VIRTUAL.<br>
If you can’t touch it and you can’t see it, it’s GONE.</p>
<p>How many software engineers does it take to change a light bulb?</p>
<ul>
<li>None. “We’ll document it in the manual.”</li>
<li>None. It’s a hardware problem.</li>
<li>1.000000001.</li>
<li>Two. One always leaves in the middle of the project.</li>
<li>Four. One to design the change, one to implement it, one to document it, and one to maintain it afterwards.</li>
<li>Four, plus one senior analyst to manage the project, one technical writer to correct the spelling and grammar of the one who documented it, one light bulb librarian, a sales-force of at least five to drum up enough users who want to turn the light on, 274 users to burn out the new bulb, at which point we go to tender for another light bulb change,…</li>
<li>Five. Two to write the specification program, one to screw it in, and two to explain why the project was late.</li>
<li>Only one, but she’s not available till the year 2000.</li>
<li>“The change is 90% complete.”</li>
<li>“It’s hard to say. Each time we separate the bulb into its modules to do unit testing, it stops working.”</li>
<li>Of course, as everyone knows, just five years ago all it took was a bunch of kids in a garage in Palo Alto to change a light bulb.</li>
</ul>
<p>How many C++ programmers does it take to change a light bulb? “You’re still thinking procedurally! A properly designed light bulb object would inherit a change method from a generic light bulb class!”</p>
<p>How many Windows programmers does it take to change a light bulb? Seventy two. One to write WinGetLightBulbHandle, one to write WinQueryStatusLightBulb, one to write WinGetLightSwitchHandle …</p>
<p>Programming is like sex: One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>The three most dangerous things in the world are a programmer with a soldering iron, a hardware engineer with a software patch, and a user with an idea.</p>
<p>Laws of Computer Programming</p>
<ul>
<li>Any given program, when running, is obsolete.</li>
<li>Any given program costs more and takes longer.</li>
<li>If a program is useful, it will have to be changed.</li>
<li>If a program is useless, it will have to be documented.</li>
<li>Any program will expand to fill available memory.</li>
<li>The value of a program is proportional to the weight of its output.</li>
<li>Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capabilities of the programmer who must maintain it.</li>
<li>Any non-trivial program contains at least one bug.</li>
<li>Undetectable errors are infinite in variety, in contrast to detectable errors, which by definition are limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a NukeChicago procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a NukeCity procedure, to which Chicago could be given as a parameter.</p>
<p>Why did the API go to sleep? It needed some REST.</p>
<p>There are 10 types of people in this world, those who understand binary and those who don’t.</p>
<p>How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? None, that’s a hardware problem.</p>
<p>Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.</p>
<p>Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</p>
<p>In the Beginning, there was no inheritance and no composition, only code.</p>
<p>You must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest … with a herring.</p>
<p>Programming is 10% science, 20% ingenuity, and 70% getting the ingenuity to work with the science.</p>
<p>I love pressing the F5 key. It’s refreshing.</p>
<p>Why are assembly programmers often wet? They work below C level.</p>
<p>If you listen to a UNIX shell, can you hear the C?</p>
<p>Unix is user friendly. It’s just very particular about who it’s friends are.</p>
<p>Why do programmers confuse Halloween with Christmas? Because Oct 31 = Dec 25.</p>
<p>An optimist says “The glass is half full.” A pessimist says “The glass is half empty.” A programmer says “The glass is twice as large as necessary.”</p>
<p>The best thing about a Boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit.</p>
<p>A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street.</p>
<p>Whats the object-oriented way to become wealthy? Inheritance.</p>
<p>There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. The other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.</p>
<p>Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to build bigger and better idiots. So far, the universe is winning.</p>
