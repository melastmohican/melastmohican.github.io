## Murphy's Laws
* If anything can go wrong, it will.
* If there is a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that will cause the most damage will be the first one to go wrong.
* If anything just cannot go wrong, it will anyway.
* If you perceive that there are four possible ways in which something can go wrong, and circumvent these, then a fifth way, unprepared for, will promptly develop.
* Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse.
* If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.
* Nature always sides with the hidden flaw.
* Mother nature is a bitch.
