      <description>Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. It enables users to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON. Terraform is platform-agnostic; you can use it to manage bare metal servers or cloud servers like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, OpenStack, and Azure. Terraform enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. It is an open-source tool that codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared amongst team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned.</description>

      <description>Intro I am developer and I like DRY. If there is any task you have to do more than once you should probably automate it. starting a new project, it can be tedious and time-consuming to start over and over again from scratch. You can use Spring Initializr to boostrap your new application or even better without leaving the shell Spring Boot CLI. You will get nice clean project with the latest versions of dependencies but what if you need to use specific internal libraries or configuration files?</description>

      <title>Migrating existing AWS infrastructure to new acount</title>

      <description>Scenario We want to migrate hundreds of AWS resources to a new account. Up to now, all resources were created manually using AWS Console or CLI tool.
CloudFormation CloudFormation is the inhouse cloud provisioning tool of AWS for declaratively describing your cloud resources.
CloudFormation is a hard, complex, inconsistent and badly documented piece of software. A stack is an atomic collection of resources in CloudFormation. Its creation or update succeeds only and only if all the resources within the stack succeed.</description>
