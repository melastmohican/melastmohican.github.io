      <description>If you are a Java programmer and are thinking of learning some more programming languages to expand your knowledge and skills, but not sure which programming languages to choose, then you are not alone. Last year there were multiple talks in our organization about migrating away from Java because o potential problems with new Oracle licensing. It is still unclear how Oracle will be auditing for Java licensing and what it will mean should an organization not be compliant.</description>

      <description>Intro I am developer and I like DRY. If there is any task you have to do more than once you should probably automate it. starting a new project, it can be tedious and time-consuming to start over and over again from scratch. You can use Spring Initializr to boostrap your new application or even better without leaving the shell Spring Boot CLI. You will get nice clean project with the latest versions of dependencies but what if you need to use specific internal libraries or configuration files?</description>
