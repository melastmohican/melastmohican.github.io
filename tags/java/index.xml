      <description>Intro Kafka supports encryption and authentication via SSL. However, the generated certificates are in Java KeyStore (JKS) format so if you need to use them in other language you need to convert them to X.509 format (.pem â€“ Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail).
Here are the commands to extract the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate:
$ keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore dev.client.truststore.jks -destkeystore server.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12 $ openssl pkcs12 -in server.p12 -nokeys -out ca_cert.pem You can then convert your client keystore to be usable from languages supporting .</description>

      <description>If you are a Java programmer and are thinking of learning some more programming languages to expand your knowledge and skills, but not sure which programming languages to choose, then you are not alone.

      <description>Intro I am developer and I like DRY. If there is any task you have to do more than once you should probably automate it. starting a new project, it can be tedious and time-consuming to start over and over again from scratch.

You will get nice clean project with the latest versions of dependencies but what if you need to use specific internal libraries or configuration files?</description>
