    <p>It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a NukeChicago procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a NukeCity procedure, to which Chicago could be given as a parameter.</p>
<p>Why did the API go to sleep? It needed some REST.</p>
<p>There are 10 types of people in this world, those who understand binary and those who don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? None, that&rsquo;s a hardware problem.</p>
<p>Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.</p>
<p>Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</p>
<p>In the Beginning, there was no inheritance and no composition, only code.</p>
<p>You must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest &hellip; with a herring.</p>
<p>Programming is 10% science, 20% ingenuity, and 70% getting the ingenuity to work with the science.</p>
<p>I love pressing the F5 key. It’s refreshing.</p>
<p>Why are assembly programmers often wet? They work below C level.</p>
<p>If you listen to a UNIX shell, can you hear the C?</p>
<p>Why do programmers confuse Halloween with Christmas? Because Oct 31 = Dec 25.</p>
<p>An optimist says “The glass is half full.”
A pessimist says “The glass is half empty.”
A programmer says “The glass is twice as large as necessary.”</p>
<p>The best thing about a Boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit.</p>
<p>A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street.</p>
<p>Whats the object-oriented way to become wealthy? Inheritance.</p>
