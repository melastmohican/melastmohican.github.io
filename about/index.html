<p>Use your brain as processor not a hard disk</p>
<p>How do you keep a programmer in the shower all day? Give him a bottle of shampoo which says &ldquo;lather, rinse, repeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you can touch it and you can see it, it&rsquo;s REAL.
If you can touch it but you can&rsquo;t see it, it&rsquo;s TRANSPARENT.
If you can&rsquo;t touch it but you can see it, it&rsquo;s VIRTUAL.
If you can&rsquo;t touch it and you can&rsquo;t see it, it&rsquo;s GONE.</p>
<p>How many software engineers does it take to change a light bulb?</p>
<ul>
<li>None. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll document it in the manual.&rdquo;</li>
<li>None. It&rsquo;s a hardware problem.</li>
<li>1.000000001.</li>
<li>Two. One always leaves in the middle of the project.</li>
<li>Four. One to design the change, one to implement it, one to document it, and one to maintain it afterwards.</li>
<li>Four, plus one senior analyst to manage the project, one technical writer to correct the spelling and grammar of the one who documented it, one light bulb librarian, a sales-force of at least five to drum up enough users who want to turn the light on, 274 users to burn out the new bulb, at which point we go to tender for another light bulb change,&hellip;</li>
<li>Five. Two to write the specification program, one to screw it in, and two to explain why the project was late.</li>
<li>Only one, but she&rsquo;s not available till the year 2000.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The change is 90% complete.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say. Each time we separate the bulb into its modules to do unit testing, it stops working.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Of course, as everyone knows, just five years ago all it took was a bunch of kids in a garage in Palo Alto to change a light bulb.</li>
</ul>
<p>How many C++ programmers does it take to change a light bulb? &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still thinking procedurally! A properly designed light bulb object would inherit a change method from a generic light bulb class!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How many Windows programmers does it take to change a light bulb? Seventy two. One to write WinGetLightBulbHandle, one to write WinQueryStatusLightBulb, one to write WinGetLightSwitchHandle &hellip;</p>
<p>Programming is like sex: One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>The three most dangerous things in the world are a programmer with a soldering iron, a hardware engineer with a software patch, and a user with an idea.</p>
<p>Laws of Computer Programming</p>
<ul>
<li>Any given program, when running, is obsolete.</li>
<li>Any given program costs more and takes longer.</li>
<li>If a program is useful, it will have to be changed.</li>
<li>If a program is useless, it will have to be documented.</li>
<li>Any program will expand to fill available memory.</li>
<li>The value of a program is proportional to the weight of its output.</li>
<li>Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capabilities of the programmer who must maintain it.</li>
<li>Any non-trivial program contains at least one bug.</li>
<li>Undetectable errors are infinite in variety, in contrast to detectable errors, which by definition are limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a NukeChicago procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a NukeCity procedure, to which Chicago could be given as a parameter.</p>
<p>Why did the API go to sleep? It needed some REST.</p>
<p>There are 10 types of people in this world, those who understand binary and those who don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? None, that&rsquo;s a hardware problem.</p>
<p>Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.</p>
<p>Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</p>
<p>In the Beginning, there was no inheritance and no composition, only code.</p>
<p>You must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest &hellip; with a herring.</p>
<p>Programming is 10% science, 20% ingenuity, and 70% getting the ingenuity to work with the science.</p>
<p>I love pressing the F5 key. It’s refreshing.</p>
<p>Why are assembly programmers often wet? They work below C level.</p>
<p>If you listen to a UNIX shell, can you hear the C?</p>
<p>Unix is user friendly. It&rsquo;s just very particular about who it&rsquo;s friends are.</p>
<p>Why do programmers confuse Halloween with Christmas? Because Oct 31 = Dec 25.</p>
<p>An optimist says “The glass is half full.”
A pessimist says “The glass is half empty.”
A programmer says “The glass is twice as large as necessary.”</p>
<p>The best thing about a Boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit.</p>
<p>A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street.</p>
<p>Whats the object-oriented way to become wealthy? Inheritance.</p>
<p>There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. The other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.</p>
<p>Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to build bigger and better idiots. So far, the universe is winning.</p>
